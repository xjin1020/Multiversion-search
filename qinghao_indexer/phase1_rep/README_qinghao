In order to run the index_qinghao.sh, you need to copy the following files to your folder:

phase1_rep/index_qinghao.sh
phase1_rep/lucene_step/run_index_new.sh
phase1_rep/lucene_step/archive_lucene_index2.jar

Please copy the above files to your folder, and DO NOT remove any old files. My script still need most of your old files.

command to index: sh index_qinghao.sh
