Firstly compile all the files by typing "make" in different folders
**********************************
Phase 1:
cd phase1/

Indexing:
(1) put your data in "fragment/data", concatenating all versions in one file.
(2) change the number in "index.sh" to your "total page number = version number * doc number per version"
(3) **./index.sh(if you also need to test baseline method)** or ./index_nolucene.sh(if you don't need to test baseline method)

**Searching (only need to be done when we are testing the baseline method)**:
(1) modify your query in "lucene_step/run_search.sh"
(2) run "./search.sh" under "phase1/" folder

**********************************
Phase 1 representative:
cd phase1_rep/

Indexing:
(1) put your representative data in "fragment/data".
(2) change the number in "index.sh" to your "total page number = representative page number"
(3) ./index.sh

Searching:
(1) modify your query in "lucene_step/run_search.sh"
(2) run "./search.sh" under "phase1_rep/" folder

**********************************
Phase 2:
cd phase2/

Indexing:
    run "index.sh" in phase2/

Searching:
(1) modify two parameters in "runjob_search.py":
    1. query_len //your query length
    2. k //the parameter for top k results retrieval from Phase 1 representative's result.
(2) run "search.sh"
