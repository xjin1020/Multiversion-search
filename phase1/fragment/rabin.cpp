/*
 * This program implements the rabin fingerprint checksum computation.
 * At this point, the code works only for normalized minimal polynomial
 * (i.e. MSB=1). If this polynomial will ever be made un-normalized,
 * the source code needs to be modified
 */

/*
 * Let f/P = g + r/P, where P is a 64-bit minimal polynomial,
 * '/' stands for the modulo P operation, and f is a windowed polynomial (of W bytes).
 * Given f = [ om ...... ] and the modulo P fingerprint r, the problem of interest
 * is how to derive the modulo P fingerprint for the next windowed polynomial f' = [ ...... m],
 * om stands for a byte to be shifted out of the window and m stands for a new byte into the window.
 * It can be shown that, f'/P = g<<8 + (r<<8 + m + om<<(8*W))/P.
 * Therefore, the modulo P fingerprint r' can be updated according to 
 * r' = (r<<8 + m + om<<(8*W)) / P. By exploiting the linearity of the xor operation,
 * the equation is solved by separating (r<<8 + m + om<<(8*W)) into 3 parts, and xor them to derive r'
 *
 * 1. (om<<(8*W))/P :  this is called old ringing from the shifted out byte om,
 *    and can be pre-computed (in rabin_init) and tabulated (256 entries).
 *    The saved om can be used as an index to the table to determine.
 *
 * 2. shifted out part of r<<8 : it should be noticed that the MSB in r is always 0,
 *    therefore, the fingerprint corresponding to the most significant 9 bits left shifted by 8,
 *    is precomputed and tabulated (256 entries). This fingerprint is called new ringing
 *    and can be computed by using r>>55 as an index to the 2nd table.
 *
 * 3. the rest of (r<<8 + m)&(~MSB64) (clear the MSB)
 *
 * The fingerprint r' can be updated according to 
 *
 * 	r' = old_ringing[om] + new_ringing[r>>55] + (r<<8 + m)&0x7fffffffffffffff; 
 *
 * Our implementation follows this algorithm.
