Albedo	
percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions albedo or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of
a surface it is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it being a dimensionless
fraction it may also be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface to
1 for perfect reflection of a white surface albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation
when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light in general the
albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation exceptions are lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions
according to a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to characterize the scattering properties of
a surface accurately although the albedo is a very useful first approximation the albedo is an important concept
in climatology and astronomy as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable rating systems for buildings
the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of the covering by clouds but varies widely locally across
the surface depending on the geological and environmental features the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria terrestrial

achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low
albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are
in an albedo range of 0 1 to 0 4 this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance
and farming for example of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult the classic example of albedo effect is the snow temperature feedback if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts
the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase the converse is also true if
snow forms a cooling cycle happens the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be
potentially very large in the tropics 2003 2004 mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo the earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated
via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model
of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates
of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g the earth s average surface temperature due to its
albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 c if the earth was frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet
would drop below 40 c if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop
to about 0 c in contrast if all the ice on earth were to melt a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 c white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that
for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle astronomical
albedo the albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by
telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface
ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives
information about regolith properties while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of
any body in the solar system with 99 of em radiation reflected another notable high
albedo body is eris with an albedo of 0 96 while such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total
proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the
directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation
between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus
allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing studies by the hadley
centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration
on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or
perhaps warming snow snow albedos can be as high as 0 9 this however is for the ideal
example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than 0 8 if a marginally snow
covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot
sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident
light it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near
the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction since the light specularly reflected
from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high
angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces
which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0
to a maximum approaching 0 8 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields
during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming
aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased
light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on
the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on
climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil
fuels is 0 2 w m 2 with a range 0 1 to 0 4 w m 2 other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of
electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
