a surface it is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation
