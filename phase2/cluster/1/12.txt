Albedo	
percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions albedo or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of
a surface it is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation
when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light in general the
albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an
albedo that is independent of the incident distribution in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo
is very useful as a first approximation the albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable
rating systems for buildings the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria terrestrial

achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low
albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are
in an albedo range of 0 1 to 0 4 this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds 2003 2004 mean annual clear sky and total
sky albedo earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board
the terra and aqua satellites as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model
of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates
of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g earth s average surface temperature
due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 c if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more
reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 c if only the continental land
masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 c in contrast if the entire earth is covered by water a so called aquaplanet
the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 c white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that
for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle astronomical
albedo the albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by
telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface
ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives
information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in
asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with 99 of em radiation reflected another notable high
albedo body is eris with an albedo of 0 96 although such reflectance properties are different from those of any
terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total
proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the
directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation
between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount
of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the sahara
desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and
sub tropical rain forest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation
plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation
areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when
local albedo changes climate and weather albedo affects climate and drives weather all weather is a result of the uneven heating of earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos essentially for the driving of weather there are two types of albedo
regions on earth land and ocean land and ocean regions produce the four basic different
types of air masses depending on latitude and therefore insolation warm and dry which form over tropical and sub tropical
land masses warm and wet which form over tropical and sub tropical oceans cold and dry which form over temperate polar and sub polar land masses
and cold and wet which form over temperate polar and sub polar oceans different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures and the masses develop into pressure systems high pressure systems flow toward lower pressure driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere and south to north in the lower however due to the spinning of earth
the coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather climate bands and the jet streams albedo temperature feedback when an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow
temperature feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening
the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening
surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus increasing the albedo further resulting in still more heating small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus
allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing studies by the hadley
centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration
on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or
perhaps warming snow snow albedos can be as high as 0 9 this however is for the ideal
example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than 0 8 if a marginally snow
covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot
sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident
light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because
light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high
angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces
which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0
to a maximum approaching 0 8 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields
during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming
aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased
light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on
the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on
climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil
fuels is 0 2 w m 2 with a range 0 1 to 0 4 w m 2 black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the
arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe
however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult other types of albedo single scattering
albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
